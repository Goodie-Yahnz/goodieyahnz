<h1><a href="https://www.goodieyahnz.com.ng/">Anim A Kri</a></h1> <p> is a very different animation app, released on 26th December 2024, by Goodie Yahnz</p>
<br>
<h2>Unlike other animation apps;</h2>
<h2> It uses CSS codes</h2>
<h2> Its framerate is not 24 frames per second, rather 12.5 fps</h2>
<h2> Its animation and drawing is done outside the app not inside</h2>
<h2> Its frames are limited to 500 frames</h2>
<br>
<h4>How to use it is to create the drawings in a separate painting app, and save them. Save many more, creating each painting in the app, you will paste each of the images in the "code created frame" between the quotations i.e "0.0 {background-image: url('');}".</h4>
<h3>THINGS TO KNOW WHEN USING ANIM A KRI</h3>
<h4><b>EMBRACING COPY AND PASTE:</b> Copy and Paste is a rule breaking animation rule that you have to follow. This is because the animation is outside and no onion skinning</h4>
<h4><b>SIMPLE DESIGNATION:</b> For Anim A Kri is best to draw something really simple than to draw a very complex drawing. That's why it's recommended to use basic shapes rather than what is painted. This is to help easy animation. So the recommended apps for character designation are Microsoft Power Point, Paint and Keynote </h4>
