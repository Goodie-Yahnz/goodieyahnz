<h3>The new way to find numbers divisible by 8 is
<p class="no1"> 
1. Seperate the last number from the rest</p>
<p class="no1">2. Multiply the rest of the numbers by 2</p>
<p class="no1">3. Add your product to the last number</p>
<p class="no1">4. If your number is another number divisible by 8. Then the number you started with is divisible by 8</p>
<p class="no1">5. If you still don't know keep implying the rule</p>
