 '''Note:''' Each Goodie Yahnz app can be made offline by clicking Ctrl + S or Saving the page.

=== Cod E Dit ===
This is the first app of Goodie Yahnz. It is a free, online app as it was no more offline until 28th Feb, 2025. Though it can be made offline by saving the page. The user writes text and it is saved as another format. And the text is also stored for future use. It works as a text editor, but specializes basically on code.

=== Anim A Kri ===
This is the second app of Goodie Yahnz. Just like Cod E Dit, Anim A Kri is a free online app that can be made offline by saving the page. The user animates by copying the file url and pasting it in the right area. It works with CSS code, but no code work is done by the user. It has 500 frames, with a frame rate of 50fps making each file duration 10 seconds.

<h3>The new way to find numbers divisible by 8 is
<p class="no1"> 
1. Seperate the last number from the rest</p>
<p class="no1">2. Multiply the rest of the numbers by 2</p>
<p class="no1">3. Add your product to the last number</p>
<p class="no1">4. If your number is another number divisible by 8. Then the number you started with is divisible by 8</p>
<p class="no1">5. If you still don't know keep implying the rule</p>
